As an earth system scientist and ecologist I model ecosystem processes, such as vegetation growth or drought / disturbance resistance, using various -retrospective- proxy measurements in a model data fusion approach, including among others remote sensing, dendrochronology and recovered historical data records.

Throughout my career I worked interdisciplinary borrowing heavily from fields, outside of ecology, such as image vision processing (computer science), remote sensing and engineering to assist in either field measurements and/or model driven analysis. In addition, I study and publish on swift migration and movement ecology.

I'm the co-founder of [BlueGreen Labs](https://bluegreenlabs.org/), a company dedicated to making sense of oceans of data and address climate change through data driven methods. In this repository you will find legacy projects which are kept for future reference. For recent work I refer to the [BlueGreen Labs github page](https://github.com/bluegreen-labs).
