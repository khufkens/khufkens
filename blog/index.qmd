Here you find my reading, writing and some observations on work, life, science and academia. Most things are written over morning coffee or during my commute/travels. This writing is stream of thought with sparse punctuation. Yet, I hope some of it might inspire others. This writing are my own opinion pieces, although they might serve as foundations for more well researched work. For all my scientific work I refer to [BlueGreen Labs](https://bluegreenlabs.org).
