The old framework of my blog was getting stale, so I'll refresh it to quarto. I'm unsure if all posts will be ported over but I'll try to keep the best of them. Time for writing extensively is limited these days, so I consider the fresh design a placeholder mostly. I hope this might change in the near future.

Some resources on the old blog might have been useful to some. However, most of these have been integrated in packages and or tutorials currently reported on the BlueGreen Labs [website](https://bluegreenlabs.org) or [github](https://github.com/bluegreen-labs) page. If you find yourself searching for an old post, following a dead link, please consider looking there for answers.
