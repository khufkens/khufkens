    "text": "Photo by British Library on Unsplash\n\n\nRecently, I more formally picked up machine learning again - in a more day-to-day fashion rather than one-off projects. Specifically, I’m trying to use R within the context of deep learning. Given that the dominant ecosystem for machine learning mostly remains python this might come as a surprise.\nThing is, I don’t like pivoting in and out of environments. In particular, data wrangling is much easier in R than in python. Given that a good amount of machine learning is dealing with cleaning data and data wrangling it often seems a better fit to use R rather than python (with the exception being image processing).\nAnyway, I tried such a deep dive a couple of years ago with the excellent book “Deep Learning with R” by Francois Cholet. Sadly, at the time, the R ecosystem of Keras felt very brittle and incomplete. But, revisiting Keras, and Torch, again after a couple of years was a breath of fresh air. The R APIs feel more feature complete and in line with the python one.\nThe last couple of days I’ve really enjoyed the combination of {torch} and {luz} to model ecosystem flux data and phenology. Some key resources have been the Posit.io (rstudio) machine learning blog - which reblogs some of the work in the “Deep Learning and Scientific Computing with R torch” by Sigrid Keydana. Given that the first book by Francois Cholet was brilliant, I assume the second version is better with the increasing ability of TensorFlow and the Keras APIs. Pick up either of these books to get a good handle on machine learning in R. Depending on if and where I find time, I might blog about some tips and tricks."

    "text": "Photo by Jonas Allert on Unsplash\n\n\nI was unsure if I would take up blogging again, or just forward the domain name to BlueGreen Labs. But, a recent Mastodon post by Carl T. Bergstrom made me realize the value of continuing after refactoring the website.\nWe are quickly going down the road of total enshitification of the web, due to the convincing nature of Large Language Model (LLM) output (think ChatGPT, Bard etc). The web will soon be filled with reams of auto-generated text not worth reading. To give you some context on where we are headed. Ever look up a recipe online these days? Notice how you had to scroll past pages of text on the life story of the author and why this recipe matters to them, while all you wanted was an ingredients list, food prep instructions and maybe a picture of how pasta puttanesca should look? This will be the web going forward, but EVERYWHERE. Finding trusted sources of information and worthwhile content to read will therefore come at a premium.\nI will therefore counter the enshitification of the web, by a handful of platforms, using the approach that made them big, i.e. by linking out.\n\n“It was perhaps the best encapsulation of a mantra I first heard from web pioneer Dave Winer: The more you send people away, the more they come back.” - Philip Bump (Musk is nearly done destroying what made Twitter twitter - Washington Post)\n\nAs such, I’ll pivot my old blog to a link blog with commentary and suggested reading links. This resonates with some of the comments I got from friends on some of the reading material I forward. This will also allow me to structure some of my thoughts and keep track of this content myself (as finding it again will increasingly be impossible).\nThis pivot also serves as a warning. Being a trusted source will become more important than ever. The importance of real life references and quality of the material written or linked to rather than “influencer” presence will dominate again (after a decade of cheap viral content and personalities who ride on it). It never really went away, as life is politics and connection, but for a brief moment one could get away with just being famous online.\n\nTo those landing here looking for old resources on the old blog: most of these have been integrated in packages and or tutorials currently reported on the BlueGreen Labs website or github page. If you find yourself searching for an old post, following a dead link, please consider looking there for answers."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Photo by Robert Booth\n\n\nThe past week some recent work on swift behaviour got published in The Proceedings of the Royal Society B. In this research I, together with a splendid team, discuss the influence of moonlight on flight behaviour and foraging tactics during the non-breeding season (across Africa) of three European swift species. This works follows on previous work in Oikos along the same research lines and by the same team, but led by Lyndon Kearsley, discussing the influence of atmospheric convergence zones on flight behaviour. Combined, these two studies provide an insight into how swifts optimize their behaviour to their flight environment, let it be wind and/or light.\nThis ornithology research grew out of the passion of Lyndon Kearsley who, as a long-term amateur ornithologist (50+ years), contributes to academic research on a regular basis but rarely as research lead. During the COVID pandemic he shared some of this passion with me, from which grew the plan to publish some of the insights which came from these discussions and subsequent conversations with other collaborators.\nPublishing science from the perspective of a small independent lab is certainly not open, as in easily accessible to all, even if ideas are good, the execution of the analysis spot-on, and the data and code openly available. I’m happy with the progress this team makes, but our largely unaffiliated status does not make our work easier. I think the scientific community, despite “broader impacts”, needs to acknowledge and consider outside contributions more seriously. Many fields still struggle with issues surrounding data ownership, proper attribution (of amateurs and citizen scientists), neo-colonialism and helicopter science and a publishing system which is increasingly financially out of reach for smaller labs.\nAcademic research can be decidedly competitive - chasing a vacuous Red Queen status quo. But, to end in a positive note, in these swift studies we took an explicit community based approach. BlueGreen Labs, through myself and Lyndon, tries to facilitate slower and open science by building knowledge, software, hardware, and a community surrounding all these aspects. We consciously stepped away from the Red Queen rat race of academic publishing, where we try to partner with diverse collaborators (co-authors) on a basis of a shared passion, expertise and trust.\nI think our work reflects the fact that one does not necessarily need a large budget to do impactful and fun science, for all involved. Research needs (interdisciplinary) community, foundation frameworks (among others in good software and hardware stacks and support/teaching), and open and honest communication with less careerism and one-upmanship. To end with a platitude: “If you want to go fast, go alone, if you want to go far, go together”.\n\n\nReferences\nHufkens, K. et al. (2023), Evaluating the effects of moonlight on the vertical flight profiles of three western palaearctic swifts.

Most projects fail when they do not account for the practical difference between what it takes to manifest the idea and realize the ideal solution."

    "text": "Failing forward\nNobody likes to bring bad news, but if your project does not manage to draw (the owl) results finding added value in other aspects of a project is key. This does not only cover lessons learned (as listed above), but also covers proposing ways out of the impasse more generally. You can fail forward by pointing out why things didn’t work out the way it should have happened, but more so, how these issues can be resolved and avoided (and at what cost) in the future.\nWhere possible generate added value by providing small tangible products during the project. To continue the owl analogy, you might not be able to draw the fully detailed owl, but you might have put together a method to draw a very nice cartoon owl. This, on its own, has a certain value. Discarding this result because it did not meet the ideal would be foolish."

    "text": "The Simpsons, Old Man and the Key\n\n\nOver the past years I’ve seen a steady decline in the problem solving ability of students, and I fear large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, might not do them any favour. Now, this might sound like an opinion of an “old man yells at cloud”. Google (search) and calculators were also once proposed to cause brain rot. But this cuts even deeper.\nMost people have some form of intrapersonal communication or inner-dialogue(s). Forms of self-talk underpin a lot of higher decision making such as self-control, self-direction but also problem solving skills. This self-talk can be positive, or negative, despite it being potentially valuable and insightful as written down by the cult classic “Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance” by Robert M. Pirsig. However, it remains largely a personal inner dialogue.\nBut, not anymore I would argue. A surprisingly large group of people have long and winding conversations with LLMs. One can see the sadness that ensues if these LLMs start replacing friendly phone calls, because LLMs are more convenient to talk to as always available and uniquely tuned to your character. But what about our inner-dialogues?\n\noutsourcing your inner-dialogue\nI think that at least some of us might be in danger of replacing their inner-dialogue with commercial for profit chat bots. These chat bots could make their internal conversation external. Surfacing your self-talk was previously the domain of psychologists or psychiatrists, this is now done under little supervision at times with deadly consequences.\nEven without dramatic consequences, erosion of internal self-critical thought seems innocent but isn’t. Students, well everybody really, need critical problem solving skills. These problem solving skills are eroding fast, on a very basic level running deeper than Google search or calculators, while being supercharged for others.\nFor those who consciously use these LLMs, being careful on how to deploy them, might actually increase their self-critical skills as it gives them that additional external perspective previously conjured by rubber duck debugging, a Socratic (dialectic) method to problem solving. Much of this technology will further entrench social inequity, between those who unconsciously see their inner-voices replaced by commercial entities (for now without ads), and those that know how to game/use the system and mostly pay for quick access, privacy and an ad-free experience.\nI fear teaching critical problem solving skills will become more and more challenging in the years to come."

    "text": "Photo by Modestas Urbonas on Unsplash\n\n\nThis is a quick post of some advice I gave about career development to an early career scientist. Take from it what you want.\n\nTry to build bridges between where you are and where you want to go (this can include people, places, topics, techniques).\nTouching on building, try to build (multiple) things (lines of research, data, code) which outlast singular projects or span several. This is why I’m relentless on using templates and formalizing code. This allows you to recycle old projects in a new context fast, so you can pivot into a new project quicker.\nDiversify your portfolio, don’t get painted into a corner. By definition ecology is interdisciplinary and chances are that you will have to do fieldwork / lab work at some point. Getting experience before you need to supervise people doing so (without any true experience) is key. Use early career years to make mistakes which in a management setting would be unforgivable (as affecting other people’s career - even more than your own).\nBuild bridges for other people! The bigger your responsibility (older you are) the more you have the ability to pay it forward (give people opportunities). You shouldn’t cannibalize your own work, but sometimes it is as easy as sending a simple email in support (or letting someone tag along or contribute). Do so!\n\nBuild bridges between people, build frameworks (foundations) to work from / upon, build diversity in your skills / interests / people and if possible encourage, and support, others to do the same."
