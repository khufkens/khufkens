    "text": "from the archive, first published on 2015-02-09\nSome things in life are free, yet fewer things remain each day.\nErosion of altruism, acts of kindness and true sharing has in large part been facilitated by the recent buzz around the “sharing” economy. In a sharing economy, or collaborative consumption, owners rent out goods or time they are not using in a peer-to-peer fashion. A common premise is that when goods and services are shared, the value of those goods may increase, for the business, for individuals, and for the community.The sharing economy allows people to offer rides through a service such as Uber and Lyft. Using AirBnB an unused room can be a source of income. While TaskRabbit makes it possible to offer a pair of helping hands while cleaning. More recently there has been as steady increase in services such as education and consultancy through sites such as Udemy and HourlyNerd."

    "text": "Disruption and (de)regulation\nOn the surface it seems promising, being hailed as ‘disruptive’ to entrenched businesses such as the taxi service and hotel industry, stirring on innovation. Although the short term advantages for consumers are all too obvious, lower taxi fares and cheaper rooms, the long term impact on society might be less rosy. Here the disruptive nature of these companies goes well beyond just innovating. More often than not these initiatives are successful because they avoid proper regulation protecting both parties as well as legally due taxes. Although AirBnB has been forced to pay tourist taxes in a growing number of cities, the fact that renting out a room stays largely unregulated still provides an unfair advantage compared to local official businesses but also allows abuse.\nCountless AirBnB mishaps can be found on the internet; such as the comedian coming home to an orgy, rooms turning into brothels and houses being trashed. Due to a lack of screening not only are clients a potential treat to a service provider’s property, service providers are also a potential treat to clients. Uber has gotten a bad rep recently by increasing number of sexual assault cases by drivers and accidents. The freedom and lack of regulations which makes these services competitive can also turn into a hazard for both the service provider as well as their clients."

    "text": "Social upheaval\nMore damaging than the direct dangers are the indirect consequences of the sharing economy. Within a sharing economy, every item in your household or every idle minute turns into an opportunity cost. Things sitting on a shelf, or time not spend working equals a loss of additional income. All of the sudden, where people used to share equipment and time, now they find or offer these ‘services’ through an app, paying or providing for what was otherwise a free community service. As the demand for these ‘sharing’ services is rising it leaves me with one question: Where did we lose our personal connection to our next door neighbours to the point where we need to use the internet to borrow a hedge trimmer?\nEven if people used to pay for certain services, for example baby sitting, the price of these services was governed by local economics. Services were offered through word of mouth and prices were set relative to the local market. Yet, the networked nature of the sharing economy opens up the whole market to service providers far outside local communities. This creates a race to the bottom in hourly wages due to an ever expanding supply of service providers. Combined with a still rotten economy, people will cut corners everywhere cutting into hourly wages, further weakening the financial position of the middle class and working poor.\nThe promise of upward social and economic mobility through the sharing economy is therefore broken from the onset. Even worse, it has the potential to cannibalize current full time jobs. Landing people with a ‘job’ without social protection, benefits or fixed hours and a steady income."

    "text": "True sharing and social-economic empowerment\nAs the sharing economy is making it easy to find ‘shared’ goods and services it makes us ever more distant from the same goods and services we would have otherwise enjoy for free, at the cost of true sharing. The sentiment might be changing with more and more people acknowledging the social and economic implications of the ‘sharing economy’ with the potential to move from commodity to commons.\nMoving commodity to commons has been happening for a long time. However, it wasn’t covered with the verbal fluff or bad habits of ‘the sharing economy’. Before Udemy made everyone a professor there was the major push for towards Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC), mainly provided by major universities. Similarly, plenty of online tutorials can be found on YouTube, made by enthousiast and professionals. For example, countless people dedicate their free time mapping the planet. Often beating Google in accuracy and update frequency during disaster relief. These services, as well as plenty others provided by the open source software community allow people to use, software, data and knowledge free of charge. These true sharing initiatives are not limited to the software world be extend into the physical world by services such as Peerby which facilitates the borrowing of things in your neighbourhood (without charging for it) or Hacker spaces which provide free or low cost access to (specialized) tools.\nAs always, technology can be used for good as well as for bad. While venture capital clearly benefits from the sharing economy, with Uber being valued at $40 billion, the final gains for the service providers might erode over time. At the same time, these commercial services eat into the social fabric that makes people borrow stuff from neighbours without a fee. I hope with time a true sharing economy will prevail."

Bergstrom made me realize the value of continuing after refactoring the website.\nWe are quickly going down the road of total enshitification of the web, due to the convincing nature of Large Language Model (LLM) output (think ChatGPT, Bard etc). The web will soon be filled with reams of auto-generated text not worth reading. To give you some context on where we are headed. Ever look up a recipe online these days? Notice how you had to scroll past pages of text on the life story of the author and why this recipe matters to them, while all you wanted was an ingredients list, food prep instructions and maybe a picture of how pasta puttanesca should look? This will be the web going forward, but EVERYWHERE. Finding trusted sources of information and worthwhile content to read will therefore come at a premium.\nI will therefore counter the enshitification of the web, by a handful of platforms, using the approach that made them big, i.e. by linking out.\n\n“It was perhaps the best encapsulation of a mantra I first heard from web pioneer Dave Winer: The more you send people away, the more they come back.” - Philip Bump (Musk is nearly done destroying what made Twitter twitter - Washington Post)\n\nAs such, I’ll pivot my old blog to a link blog with commentary and suggested reading links. This resonates with some of the comments I got from friends on some of the reading material I forward. This will also allow me to structure some of my thoughts and keep track of this content myself (as finding it again will increasingly be impossible).\nThis pivot also serves as a warning. Being a trusted source will become more important than ever. The importance of real life references and quality of the material written or linked to rather than “influencer” presence will dominate again (after a decade of cheap viral content and personalities who ride on it). It never really went away, as life is politics and connection, but for a brief moment one could get away with just being famous online.\n\nTo those landing here looking for old resources on the old blog: most of these have been integrated in packages and or tutorials currently reported on the BlueGreen Labs website or github page.

    "text": "Photo by Paul Melki on Unsplash\nBrittle code is code which is hard to maintain and or change. Large projects with brittle code accrue a technological / code debt. Depending on the size of the debt this debt will never be fully repaid, and if it escalates will grind a project to a halt.\nBrittle code and code debt is most commonly gathered over time due to a focus on features rather than a focus on maintainability and stability. An initial focus on features is common in growth phases, but consolidation and maintainability should be implemented before widespread use (commercially or privately in a lab setting). These are some tips to avoid brittle code."

    "text": "Avoiding brittle code\nBrittle code is hard to maintain code. A number of factors affect the maintainability of codebases.\n\ndependencies\nThe more dependencies code has the more likely it will break. This situation is critically illustrated by the cartoon below. By extension, never build code on immature external codebases. Maturing code is prone to ad-hoc changes, depreciation of features etc. Keep track of your dependencies!\nsize vs. functionality\nThe larger a codebase the harder it is to maintain, the larger the code debt it carries. Keep projects as large as the basic functionality requires. Extra functionality should reside in a new codebase. Large projects can be split up, but again this comes at a large code debt. It is best to not let a codebase grow beyond its basic use.\ndocumentation\nDocument code while you write it, this includes annotations but also formal documentation for users. Putting off writing the documentation and its framework until last will increase your code debt. For formal releases and well documented code consider that up to 50% of your time will be dedicated to documenting user and developer documentation.\nYes, this seems tedious and not necessary at the time, and it isn’t as sexy as implementing that new feature. BUT, if you return to old code and can’t figure out what is going on by reading along you will gather more code debt than it would have cost you to document things up front.\nunit tests\nTogether with documentation unit tests should be written. This validates the functioning of the code, and ensures that any pull requests submitted works as intended. Failing to do so will increase the code debt of a project, if not that of a colleagues by forwarding issues downstream.\nbranches should be short lived\nBranches should be short lived and have one particular focus. Stale branches should be deleted. Side development is probably best done in a forked version independent of the main project. Again, long lived branches will gather many functions. These new functions if out of sync with the main branch will create conflicts with other ongoing development. This will generated failed unit tests, and a general brittle state of the codebase. Branch, fix, merge. If a branch is older than two weeks it should probably been a fork (i.e. experimental features - or formal research project, or the assigned taskset is too large - split it up).\ncode for the reader\nCode for the reader of the code. Compiled code (packages) ignores comments. There is no need to be clever and “short”. Comment what you do in front of chunks (not in chunks as this will overrun line length constraints and give all kinds of compilation issues). Avoid one-liners (nested / piped functions), in this regard the R {tidyverse} and its piped setup can quickly become painful in terms of readability, as it violates this rule. Use the R {tidyverse} sparingly with short piped sections, as it is hard to read / debug with longer constructs.\npersonal & team responsibility\nAs a team you decide to keep code debt low. You don’t have the right to break a code base with the expectation that someone else on the team will fix it (see unit tests above)."

    "title": "Burn the candle at both ends",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Photo by Paul Melki on Unsplash\n\n\nAcademic researchers are being squeezed from both ends by publishers. This is by design.\nNot so long ago Cory Doctorow pitched the word “enshitification” for the state of the internet, and in particular the rise and ultimate decline of (tech) platforms. Per Doctorow, “platforms are firms which mediate between end users and business customers”. In the scorching video at DEFCON31 Doctorow picks apart the decline of these entities, or why they will fold.\n\n\n\n\nWhere Uber connects drivers with riders and Amazon connects buyers with sellers. Where first a platform is good to its users, which will then draw business customers. Finally, when both are locked-in, for a lack of alternatives and entrenched patterns, the platform will bring down the hammer on both (extracting all value from both customers and business alike). But, although both users and businesses using the platforms will be robbed they mostly represent separate entities (e.g. drivers and riders of an Uber taxi).\n\nAcademic publishing as a platform\nNow, in the effective oligopoly market of academic publishing platforms this is driven to a peak as users and business customers are the same people, only separated by time in their research workflow. Researchers read, “consume”, academic literature, where at the end of their research workflow they are in the business of “producing” new academic literature. The academic publishing platform only mediates between the same group of people separated by time - squeezing them at both ends. This process can only be described as a highly lucrative scam.\n\nOverall, the market has significantly consolidated since 2000 — when the top 5 publishers held 39% of the market of articles to 2022 where they control 61% of it. Looking at larger sets of publishers makes the consolidation even more extreme, as the top 10 largest publishers went from 47% of the market in 2000 to 75% in 2023, and the top 20 largest publishers from 54% to controlling 83% of the corpus. - The Scholary Kitchen\n\nThe drive for ever higher returns, reaching up to 30% (with some estimates even higher) and exceeding most tech platforms, puts an extreme burden on researchers and funding agencies. Where the proposed shift towards open access should have resolved some of the woes of accessibility in research, it only has boosted the further enshitification of academic publishing. Publishers actively double dip with mixed “open access” articles in otherwise closed access journals. This requires libraries or individual researches to still pay for journal subscriptions, with only those articles made open by the wealthy.\nIncreasingly, those same users and business customers are squeezed in other places of the value chain as well. Review times get shorter, paper mills and vacuous “special issues” and the active manipulation of researchers due to social media and other tokens (e.g. AltMetrics and Publons) make research and publishing harder. At the same time, additional value is extracted from the IP signed away and the consolidation of most of the academic workflow in other domains (citation management, data brokerage etc).\n\n\nA way out of enshitification\nOne has to question, when will this system break? Currently what gets published outpaces the admission of new PhDs. One can argue that the vast amounts of research published today is either fake or only there to boost someone’s h-index, not the creative enterprise which is science. Sadly, most efforts to address this strong-link problem are on the weak and wrong end of the problem. Listing all predatory journals doesn’t make the good (society) journals stand out more.\nA true measure of excellence would require a contextual analysis of scientific research, not only counting citations. Where the creation of Large Language Models might further pollute academic publishing the underlying Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods could offer solutions to provide contextual analysis. But here metrics might soon become the target once more, rather than a means of fair assessment.\nThe low tech option would be for researchers to step back and demonstrate academic humility. We need to return to slow, i.e. deliberate and creative scientific research, by abandoning the Red Queen logic of a publishing treadmill leading nowhere. Excellence should not merely be measured by popularity, but by the quality of the work delivered, the dialogue it opened up, the service it provided to the scientific community or the public, and the long term value of it.\n\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY 4.0CitationBibTeX citation:@online{hufkens2023,\n  author = {Hufkens, Koen},\n  title = {Burn the Candle at Both Ends},\n  date = {2023-12-12},\n  url = {https://khufkens.com/posts/enshitification-of-academic-publishing},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nHufkens, Koen. 2023. “Burn the Candle at Both Ends.”\nDecember 12, 2023. https://khufkens.com/posts/enshitification-of-academic-publishing."

    "text": "Photo by Robert Booth\n\n\nThe past week some recent work on swift behaviour got published in The Proceedings of the Royal Society B. In this research I, together with a splendid team, discuss the influence of moonlight on flight behaviour and foraging tactics during the non-breeding season (across Africa) of three European swift species. This works follows on previous work in Oikos along the same research lines and by the same team, but led by Lyndon Kearsley, discussing the influence of atmospheric convergence zones on flight behaviour. Combined, these two studies provide an insight into how swifts optimize their behaviour to their flight environment, let it be wind and/or light.\nThis ornithology research grew out of the passion of Lyndon Kearsley who, as a long-term amateur ornithologist (50+ years), contributes to academic research on a regular basis but rarely as research lead. During the COVID pandemic he shared some of this passion with me, from which grew the plan to publish some of the insights which came from these discussions and subsequent conversations with other collaborators.\nPublishing science from the perspective of a small independent lab is certainly not open, as in easily accessible to all, even if ideas are good, the execution of the analysis spot-on, and the data and code openly available. I’m happy with the progress this team makes, but our largely unaffiliated status does not make our work easier. I think the scientific community, despite “broader impacts”, needs to acknowledge and consider outside contributions more seriously. Many fields still struggle with issues surrounding data ownership, proper attribution (of amateurs and citizen scientists), neo-colonialism and helicopter science and a publishing system which is increasingly financially out of reach for smaller labs.\nAcademic research can be decidedly competitive - chasing a vacuous Red Queen status quo. But, to end in a positive note, in these swift studies we took an explicit community based approach. BlueGreen Labs, through myself and Lyndon, tries to facilitate slower and open science by building knowledge, software, hardware, and a community surrounding all these aspects. We consciously stepped away from the Red Queen rat race of academic publishing, where we try to partner with diverse collaborators (co-authors) on a basis of a shared passion, expertise and trust.\nI think our work reflects the fact that one does not necessarily need a large budget to do impactful and fun science, for all involved. Research needs (interdisciplinary) community, foundation frameworks (among others in good software and hardware stacks and support/teaching), and open and honest communication with less careerism and one-upmanship. To end with a platitude: “If you want to go fast, go alone, if you want to go far, go together”.\n\n\nReferences\nHufkens, K. et al. (2023), Evaluating the effects of moonlight on the vertical flight profiles of three western palaearctic swifts.

    "text": "The Simpsons, Old Man and the Key\n\n\nOver the past years I’ve seen a steady decline in the problem solving ability of students. I fear large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, might not do them a favour.\nNow, this might sound like an opinion of an “old man yells at cloud”. Google (search) and calculators were also once proposed to cause brain rot. But this cuts even deeper.\nMost people have some form of intrapersonal communication or inner-dialogue(s). Forms of self-talk underpin a lot of higher decision making such as self-control, self-direction but also problem solving skills. This self-talk can be positive, or negative, despite it being potentially valuable and insightful as written down by the cult classic “Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance” by Robert M. Pirsig. However, it remains largely a personal inner dialogue.\nBut, not anymore I would argue. A surprisingly large group of people have long and winding conversations with LLMs or have AI girlfriends. One can see the sadness that ensues if these LLMs start replacing friendly phone calls, because LLMs are more convenient to talk to as always available and uniquely tuned to your character. But what about our inner-dialogues?\n\noutsourcing your inner-dialogue\nI think that at least some of us might be in danger of replacing their inner-dialogue with commercial for profit chat bots. These chat bots could make their internal conversation external. Surfacing your self-talk was previously the domain of psychologists or psychiatrists, this is now done under little supervision at times with deadly consequences.\nEven without dramatic consequences, erosion of internal self-critical thought seems innocent but isn’t. Students, well everybody really, need critical problem solving skills. These problem solving skills are eroding fast, on a very basic level running deeper than Google search or calculators, while being supercharged for others.\nFor those who consciously use these LLMs, being careful on how to deploy them, might actually increase their self-critical skills as it gives them that additional external perspective previously conjured by rubber duck debugging, a Socratic (dialectic) method to problem solving. Much of this technology will further entrench social inequity, between those who unconsciously see their inner-voices replaced by commercial entities (for now without ads), and those that know how to game/use the system and mostly pay for quick access, privacy and an ad-free experience.\nI fear teaching critical problem solving skills will become more and more challenging in the years to come.\n\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY 4.0CitationBibTeX citation:@online{hufkens2023,\n  author = {Hufkens, Koen},\n  title = {Lost Inner Voices},\n  date = {2023-11-05},\n  url = {https://khufkens.com/posts/lost-inner-voices-llm-impact-problem-solving-chatgpt-ml-teaching},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nHufkens, Koen. 2023. “Lost Inner Voices.” November 5, 2023.\nhttps://khufkens.com/posts/lost-inner-voices-llm-impact-problem-solving-chatgpt-ml-teaching."

    "text": "Academia suffers from cognitive and intellectual poverty due to a persistent (time) scarcity mindset (imposed by poor incentives). It is well documented that financially poor people suffer from a scarcity mindset, which erodes core cognitive functions. This scarcity mindsets clouds decisions, prioritizing small short-term gains over long-term larger profits by affecting planning ability.\nA recent studies highlighted the decline in disruptive science (Kozlov, Nature 2023) and record number of paper retractions (Van Noorden, Nature 2023). I would argue that this, in part, is driven by a scarcity mindset leading to creative and intellectual poverty.\nScientists have, over time, been forced from a position of relative creative freedom into one which often focuses on chasing (more) funding. Although the true role of scientists is creative discovery and to train a new generation of scientists, this role has taken a back seat. The scarcity mindset in chasing funding has polluted and crowded out creativity and mentorship for all but the lucky few, who have some financial stability or idealistic willingness.\nBy consequence, mentoring has little priority outside the performative duties, happily offloaded to adjunct “teaching” professors or post-docs where possible. Phds and post-docs are left to fend for themselves in many cases, being left with little or no true guidance. In this context, students, Phds and post-docs are increasingly seen as cheap labour, not an opportunity to teach the next generation of scientists.\nUltimately, this scarcity mindset not only affects students, Phds and post-docs poorly (as extensively documented) it is also is detrimental to science in general. As Kozlov has shown, disruptive science has decreased, while year-over-year the working conditions of Phds and post-docs are described as barely scraping by. More so, it is an incentive to let things slide, and opening the door to poor research if not outright fraud to get ahead.\nThe net societal gain of the academic scarcity mindset is therefore slim. The personal cost, for the next generation of scientists, lacking mentorship, all the more dire. As with true poverty, a scarcity mindset is generational, where people who get out of poverty will suffer from this mindset for many years after, perpetuate all its ills and slow down the needed personal changes.\n\nEscaping the scarcity trap\n\nAcknowledge mentorship\nMentorship is theoretically central to the task of academic faculty. Acknowledge this role, and avoid window dressing with numbers. Show up and stand up for students, and move the discussion from results to the process on how to work and manage efficiently, and larger / long term goals which do not necessarily include components which are academically commensurable.\n\n\nBuild with and for people, relentlessly\nFunding and investing in mentorship are not mutually exclusive, but have a higher upfront cost (in time). However, building things with highly trained people is also more efficient. Consider the long term pay-off on investing in people, and working with them.\n\n\nManage down, then up.\nMost professors manage up, i.e. they try to coerce favours/collaborations with their peers or administrators higher up. Although this is often required, the needs of a lab are larger than the personal project needs of a professor. Without managing down and acknowledging the foundation of a research group, i.e. taking stock and aligning values with anyone you work with, it will be hard to address the true needs of a lab. If people need to actively manage up to get what they need from a supervisor there is something amiss. Practice active listening and be pro-active. Tap into your experience to anticipate the (practical and other) needs of people, adjust in deliberation.\n\n\nUnderstand lab culture(s)\nLab culture changes over time and with backgrounds, diversity, generations, technologies, overall societal cultural expectations and across institutions. Acknowledge this fact and try to understand these varying dynamics. Being stuck in your own generation will limit the ways in which you can communicate with those who you mentor. Try to bridge cultural divides actively.\n\n\nBe generous, and invert implicit power dynamics\nEven tenure track professors are in a position of power relative to those on fixed-term contracts (phds / post-docs). Acknowledge this privilege by actively lifting people up and creating opportunities for them and with them. Lobby on behalf of students even if this does not directly benefit you.\n\n\nThere is no such thing as being scooped\nAcknowledge that you are part of a scientific dialogue in which certain ideas circulate. Most scientists are not singular geniuses, their work reflects the themes and topics of the societies in which they move. The notion of being scoped, and teaching students to worry about this, only perpetuates a scarcity mindset and intellectual anemia.\n\n\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY 4.0CitationBibTeX citation:@online{hufkens2024,\n  author = {Hufkens, Koen},\n  title = {Creative and Intellectual Poverty},\n  date = {2024-01-18},\n  url = {https://khufkens.com/posts/creative-poverty-scarcity-mindset-academia},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nHufkens, Koen. 2024. “Creative and Intellectual Poverty.”\nJanuary 18, 2024. https://khufkens.com/posts/creative-poverty-scarcity-mindset-academia."

    "text": "Photo by Kelly Sikkema on Unsplash\n\n\nI teach people in project (code) management to fail gracefully. When things fail you should have an easy recovery, and a backup plan. Without change, climate change policy will not fail gracefully. The recent shoulder shrugs on reporting of a slowing Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), an ocean current redistributing heat across the Atlantic with local and global climate importance, and only confirm this historical stance.\nThis means that students have to document what they do, but also trap errors in their reasoning and/or use cases of whomever comes after them. Similarly, I tell students that when managing a project the need to walk through scenarios which might mess up all remaining work, i.e. single points of failure. For anything important, you need to mitigate issues upfront and have possible adaptation options. Generally, you can’t afford single points of failure.\n\nA single point of failure\nClimate tipping points are single points of failure. Tipping points impose rapid and irreversible change and excludes graceful failure as the speed at which it occurs excludes adaptation.\nA recent article in Science Advances zooms in on the issue of the slowing down or collapse of the AMOC. It solidifies previous statistical work around the weakening of the AMOC, and finds early warning signals in line with previous studies.\nhttps://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adk1189\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/feb/09/atlantic-ocean-circulation-nearing-devastating-tipping-point-study-finds\nThis latest study has a number of climate scientists shifting uncomfortably in their chairs. The hope was, given uncertainties in previous studies, that it might all not go too fast. Sadly, this research confirms this previous work, with physical modelling supporting the previous statistical analysis. Currently, there are numbers floating around the scientific community for this shift to start happening potentially as early as mid century (2050).\nThe consequences of this tipping point, as outlined in the paper, are profound and would unfold over short decades. It would mean a rapid decline in temperature and precipitation in Europe, and the reversal of the seasonal rains across the Amazon (jeopardizing another potential tipping point). These changes would unfold too quickly for adaptation of say agricultural policy.\nYet, from a policy perspective we collectively seem to look at this and shrug while rapidly progressing towards this tipping point, from a position which already is too close for comfort. Given the stakes of this particular tipping point one would expect more profound actions, and a sense of urgency.\nTo quote Jeffrey Kargel, senior scientist at the Planetary Science Institute in Arizona, to CNN:\n\n… a potentially imminent shutdown of the AMOC “will remain somewhat controversial until, one year, we know that it is happening.”\n– Jeffrey Kargel\nhttps://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/09/climate/atlantic-circulation-collapse-weather-climate/index.html\n\nOne can only conclude that climate policy, even in the face of overwhelming evidence, seems to have a very poor failure mode.\n\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY 4.0CitationBibTeX citation:@online{hufkens2024,\n  author = {Hufkens, Koen},\n  title = {Poor Failure Modes},\n  date = {2024-02-10},\n  url = {https://khufkens.com/posts/poor-failure-modes-climate-change},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nHufkens, Koen. 2024. “Poor Failure Modes.” February 10,\n2024. https://khufkens.com/posts/poor-failure-modes-climate-change."

    "text": "Photo by British Library on Unsplash\n\n\nRecently, I more formally picked up machine learning again - in a more day-to-day fashion rather than one-off projects. Specifically, I’m trying to use R within the context of deep learning. Given that the dominant ecosystem for machine learning mostly remains python this might come as a surprise.\nThing is, I don’t like pivoting in and out of environments. In particular, data wrangling is much easier in R than in python. Given that a good amount of machine learning is dealing with cleaning data and data wrangling it often seems a better fit to use R rather than python (with the exception being image processing).\nAnyway, I tried such a deep dive a couple of years ago with the excellent book “Deep Learning with R” by Francois Cholet. Sadly, at the time, the R ecosystem of Keras felt very brittle and incomplete. But, revisiting Keras, and Torch, again after a couple of years was a breath of fresh air. The R APIs feel more feature complete and in line with the python one.\nThe last couple of days I’ve really enjoyed the combination of {torch} and {luz} to model ecosystem flux data and phenology. Some key resources have been the Posit.io (rstudio) machine learning blog - which reblogs some of the work in the “Deep Learning and Scientific Computing with R torch” by Sigrid Keydana. Given that the first book by Francois Cholet was brilliant, I assume the second version is better with the increasing ability of TensorFlow and the Keras APIs. Pick up either of these books to get a good handle on machine learning in R. Depending on if and where I find time, I might blog about some tips and tricks.\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY 4.0CitationBibTeX citation:@online{hufkens2023,\n  author = {Hufkens, Koen},\n  title = {Torch/Keras in {R}},\n  date = {2023-10-30},\n  url = {https://khufkens.com/posts/machine-learning-torch-R-luz},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nHufkens, Koen. 2023. “Torch/Keras in R.” October 30, 2023.\nhttps://khufkens.com/posts/machine-learning-torch-R-luz."

This does not only cover lessons learned (as listed above), but also covers proposing ways out of the impasse more generally. You can fail forward by pointing out why things didn’t work out the way it should have happened, but more so, how these issues can be resolved and avoided (and at what cost) in the future.\nWhere possible generate added value by providing small tangible products during the project. To continue the owl analogy, you might not be able to draw the fully detailed owl, but you might have put together a method to draw a very nice cartoon owl. This, on its own, has a certain value. Discarding this result because it did not meet the ideal would be foolish."

    "text": "Photo by Robson Hatsukami Morgan on Unsplash\nTerrestrial astronomy, and the cultural heritage which is our night sky, is being threatened by new sources of light pollution. These new sources of light pollution stem from developing technologies and are harder to mitigate, due to physics and the lack of accountability.\nGrowing up in Flanders, among the most light polluted areas in the world and the poorest place to attempt to watch the night sky from, I’m keenly aware that light pollution has always plagued visible astronomy observations in more densely populated areas. However, due to the mercury lamps and their narrow spectrum, fixes were available for visible astronomy.\nThe trend to replace mercury street lights with the more energy efficient LED lamps has turned the tables on this fix, and has made light polllution worse. The spectrum of these lights is broader, and therefore harder to filter out. The use of proper lamp fixtures, reducing the use of lights on roads after peak rush hours is more important than ever. For these earth-bound light pollution problems policy and engineering solutions can easily be found. Yet, a new breed of light pollution is far harder to fix, namely space bound / satellite based light pollution.\nIn recent years, large constellations of satellites have been launched in support of satellite based internet providers such as SpaceX’s Starlink. Starlink alone doubled the orbiting satellites as of writing, where this does not even represents the full constellation! Many more will follow for a similar project the Amazon’s Kuiper project. These platforms, and other private satellites, reflect the Sun’s light and brighten the night sky’s background ever so slightly.\nWhere for the public the effect might be aesthetic, for astronomers, when zooming in on a small fraction of the sky, these reflections will show up as intrusive streaks across astronomical images acquired for research. In an opinion piece in Nature, Dr. Sam Lawler describes the full impact of this satellite based light pollution on terrestrial astronomy observations. The take home is that there is little accountability on these matters."

Changes are considered where technology allows it, but by and large they force a brighter sky on everyone, hampering research but also space security efforts in monitoring near-earth objects. This untouchable position on how to use space is distressing, but not different from the indifference to public resources of these private companies. In an aside, on the social network Mastodon she also documented the full impact of the legal aspects of this problem. Not only was the article tone policed by the lawyers of Nature, in fear of lawsuits, it was also tacitly acknowledged by the editor that terrestrial based astronomy is mostly on the way out.\n\n\n\nIn this context space based astronomy can not replace terrestrial observations due to the limited capacity of space-borne platforms. More so, depending on the orbit these space telescopes might not be free of the same interference either if flying lower than the offending satellite constellations. It is clear that even outer space and orbital trajectories can become congested, if not dangerously so (e.g. the Kessler syndrome). Let’s hope that these platforms will show due diligence in cleaning up their act, as well as properly de-orbiting their satellites after use and decreasing their surface brightness dramatically to save our night sky. Little time is left to show these intentions, if not regulation should guarantee all these aspects."

From what I see I can only be proud of the whole class group, with generally well structured projects and clean code.\nWe live in a world of search and ChatGPT, which make the task of teaching data science at times difficult. There is the obvious proliferation of the poor code snippets, but at the heart of it all this sits the ability to easily search unstructured data.\nAll students have known a world without effective digital search, with Google launching in ~1998. Search dominates everything from laptop menus and smartphones alike. Incentives to sort or structure data are far and few between in their digital world. Yet, in absence of effective search unstructured data is the curse of anyone who needs to curate it - or when collaborating in a team setting. The assumption that effective search will always be available is also a flawed one.\nCurrent advances in LLM now have the ability to expand search past mere indexing into the domain of context aware classification and prompt-based interrogation of digital documents. For example Bing co-pilot now offers Retrieval-Augmented Generation abilities for free in their search (where search queries “read” webpages and other documents). However, searching through increasing amounts of unstructured data in need of contextualization is predicated on vast amounts of computational power, and does not provide a solution for sharing these searched collections with others.\nI’ve always taken the position that small upfront investments in decreasing the cognitive load can vastly improve the ability to search/order data yourself. This is reflected in my data science approaches, providing templates for writing software, managing data and organizing research. These techniques are far from new, as any librarian will tell you. Libraries used to operate on principles of indexed systems. Everything needs its place and an index structure to be easily searched, without search algorithms.\nThis semester the students managed to expand their skills both in data science coding, but most importantly in my opinion, in managing their projects cleanly in order to more easily collaborate with others (and their future selves). I think the approach suggested was a gentle introduction on why structure matters, without going full Marie Kondo. I hope these skills serve them well.\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY 4.0CitationBibTeX citation:@online{hufkens2023,\n  author = {Hufkens, Koen},\n  title = {End of Semester Lessons},\n  date = {2023-12-16},\n  url = {https://khufkens.com/posts/end-of-semester-and-reflections-on-data-management},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nHufkens, Koen. 2023. “End of Semester Lessons.” December\n16, 2023. https://khufkens.com/posts/end-of-semester-and-reflections-on-data-management."

Take from it what you want.\n\nTry to build bridges between where you are and where you want to go (this can include people, places, topics, techniques).\nTouching on building, try to build (multiple) things (lines of research, data, code) which outlast singular projects or span several. This is why I’m relentless on using templates and formalizing code. This allows you to recycle old projects in a new context fast, so you can pivot into a new project quicker.\nDiversify your portfolio, don’t get painted into a corner. By definition ecology is interdisciplinary and chances are that you will have to do fieldwork / lab work at some point. Getting experience before you need to supervise people doing so (without any true experience) is key. Use early career years to make mistakes which in a management setting would be unforgivable (as affecting other people’s career - even more than your own).\nBuild bridges for other people! The bigger your responsibility (older you are) the more you have the ability to pay it forward (give people opportunities). You shouldn’t cannibalize your own work, but sometimes it is as easy as sending a simple email in support (or letting someone tag along or contribute). Do so!\n\nBuild bridges between people, build frameworks (foundations) to work from / upon, build diversity in your skills / interests / people and if possible encourage, and support, others to do the same.\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY 4.0CitationBibTeX citation:@online{hufkens2023,\n  author = {Hufkens, Koen},\n  title = {Building Bridges},\n  date = {2023-10-10},\n  url = {https://khufkens.com/posts/building-bridges-science-management},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nHufkens, Koen. 2023. “Building Bridges.” October 10, 2023.\nhttps://khufkens.com/posts/building-bridges-science-management."
